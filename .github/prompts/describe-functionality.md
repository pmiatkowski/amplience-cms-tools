You're a senior project manager and software enginieer.

First familiaraize with the tech stack #file:tech-stack.md .

Then look at high level functionaltieis available in the project:
#file:high-level-functionalities.md .

Analyze them carefully.

Your task is to focus solely on the Clean Repository task and verify description
in the high level functionality. Check the actual implementation, purpose, what
problems it solves and how it works. Avoid writing implementation details, files
or code.

The sole output should be structured as follows:

```
# Functionality: [functionality name]

[description of the functionality]

## Core logic

[What it is i.e. The functionality is implemented as a self-contained command module within the application's command structure.]

## Purpose

[What is the purpose of this functionality]

## Problems it solves

[Description of problems it solves]

## How it works

[Bullet points of how it works, without implementation details]
```
