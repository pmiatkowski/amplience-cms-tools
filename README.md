# Amplience CMS Tools

A comprehensive command-line interface tool for automating bulk operations
within Amplience CMS. This tool provides efficient content management operations
that are not available through the standard Amplience UI, featuring interactive
prompts, advanced filtering, and detailed reporting.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Hub Support**: Work with multiple Amplience environments (DEV,
  PLAYGROUND, PROD)
- **Comprehensive Bulk Operations**: 11 specialized commands for different
  content management tasks
- **Two-Layer Architecture**: Clean separation between user interface (commands)
  and business logic (actions)
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter content items by schema ID, status, publication
  state, and delivery key patterns
- **Safe Operations**: Built-in dry-run mode with explicit confirmation for live
  execution
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generate comprehensive Markdown reports for all
  operations
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly prompts and progress indicators
- **Amplience DC-CLI Integration**: Leverages official Amplience tooling for
  schema operations
- **Cross-Hub Operations**: Support for content migration and synchronization
  between different hubs

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js v22.0.0 or higher
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Access to Amplience CMS with appropriate API credentials

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd amplience-cms-tools
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file and fill in your Amplience API credentials for each
   environment.

## üîß Configuration

The tool requires environment-specific configuration in the `.env` file. The
tool automatically discovers hub configurations using the following naming
convention:

```env
# Hub Configuration Pattern: AMP_HUB_<HUBNAME>_<PROPERTY>
# All four properties must be present for a hub to be recognized

# Development Environment
AMP_HUB_DEV_CLIENT_ID=your_dev_client_id
AMP_HUB_DEV_CLIENT_SECRET=your_dev_client_secret
AMP_HUB_DEV_HUB_ID=your_dev_hub_id
AMP_HUB_DEV_HUB_NAME=DEV

# Production Environment
AMP_HUB_PROD_CLIENT_ID=your_prod_client_id
AMP_HUB_PROD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_prod_client_secret
AMP_HUB_PROD_HUB_ID=your_prod_hub_id
AMP_HUB_PROD_HUB_NAME=PROD

# You can add any number of hubs by following this pattern
```

**Key Benefits of New Configuration:**

- **Auto-Discovery**: No need to maintain a central list of hubs
- **Simplified Setup**: Just add the four required variables for each hub
- **Reduced Errors**: Misconfigurations are automatically detected

**Migration from Previous Version:**

If you're upgrading from a previous version that used `AMP_HUBS`, simply:

1. Remove the `AMP_HUBS` variable from your `.env` file
2. Rename your hub variables from `AMP_<HUBNAME>_*` to `AMP_HUB_<HUBNAME>_*`
3. Ensure all four properties are present for each hub

Performs comprehensive cleanup of a repository by archiving content items with
support for hierarchical structures and complex filtering options.

### 2. Cleanup Folder

**Command**: Cleanup Folder  
**Documentation**: [cleanup-folder.md](docs/cleanup-folder.md)

Moves all content items from a folder to a designated deleted folder, archives
them, and removes empty folder structures systematically.

### 3. Copy Folder with Content

**Command**: Copy Folder with Content  
**Documentation**: [copy-folder-with-content.md](docs/copy-folder-with-content.md)

Duplicates a complete folder structure and its content from source to
destination, supporting cross-hub content migration and duplication.

### 4. List Folder Tree Structure

**Command**: List folder tree structure  
**Documentation**: [list-folder-tree.md](docs/list-folder-tree.md)

Visualizes repository folder hierarchy in multiple formats (tree, table, JSON)
with detailed statistics and navigation options.

### 5. Recreate Content Items

**Command**: Recreate Content Items  
**Documentation**: [recreate-content-items.md](docs/recreate-content-items.md)

Recreates content items across different hubs, repositories, and folders with
comprehensive filtering, hierarchy handling, and locale management.

### 6. Recreate Folder Structure

**Command**: Recreate Folder Structure  
**Documentation**: [recreate-folder-structure.md](docs/recreate-folder-structure.md)

Replicates folder hierarchies from source to target locations without content,
perfect for environment setup and structural consistency.

### 7. Sync Content Type Schemas

**Command**: Sync Content Type Schemas  
**Documentation**: [sync-content-type-schemas.md](docs/sync-content-type-schemas.md)

Synchronizes content type schemas between hubs using Amplience DC-CLI, ensuring
consistent content models across environments.

## TODO

- Add reporting for each action
- Add task feature for predefined operations (actions will require context
  parameters first)

## Known Issues

- Syncing content type schemas is too slow due to implementation. Needs to be
  revised.
