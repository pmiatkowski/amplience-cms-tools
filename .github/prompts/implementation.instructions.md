Your task is to implement a frontend view based on the provided implementation
plan and implementation rules. Your goal is to create a detailed and accurate
implementation that aligns with the provided plan, correctly represents the
component structure, integrates with the API, and handles all specified user
interactions.

First, review the implementation plan:

<implementation_plan> {{implementation-plan}} <- replace with a reference to the
</implementation_plan>

Now, review the implementation rules:

<implementation_rules> {{frontend-rules}} <- replace with a reference to the
frontend rules (e.g., @shared.mdc, @frontend.mdc, @astro.mdc, @react.mdc,
@ui-shadcn-helper.mdc) </implementation_rules>

Review the defined types:

<types>
  {{types}} <- replace with a reference to the DTO definitions (e.g., @types.ts)
</types>

Implement the plan according to the following approach:

<implementation_approach> Implement a maximum of 3 steps of the implementation
plan, briefly summarize what you have done, and describe the plan for the next 3
actions - stop at this point and wait for my feedback.
</implementation_approach>

Carefully analyze the implementation plan and rules. Pay close attention to the
component structure, API integration requirements, and user interactions
described in the plan.

Follow these steps to implement the frontend view:

1. Functions Structure

- Identify all components listed in the implementation plan.
- Create a hierarchical structure for these components.
- Ensure that the responsibilities and relationships of each component are
  clearly defined.

2. API Integration Identify all API endpoints mentioned in the plan.

- Implement the necessary API calls for each endpoint.
- Handle the API responses and update the component state accordingly.

3. User Interactions List all user interactions specified in the implementation
   plan.

- Implement event handlers for each interaction.
- Ensure that each interaction triggers the appropriate action or state change.

4. Styling and Layout Apply the specified styling and layout as mentioned in the
   implementation plan.

- Ensure responsiveness if required by the plan.

5. Error Handling and Edge Cases Implement error handling for API calls and user
   interactions.

- Consider and handle potential edge cases mentioned in the plan.

6. Performance Optimization Implement any performance optimizations specified in
   the plan or rules.

- Ensure efficient rendering and minimize unnecessary re-renders.

78. Testing If specified in the plan, implement unit tests for components and
    functions.

- Thoroughly test all user interactions and API integrations.
- Throughout the entire implementation process, you must strictly adhere to the
  provided implementation rules. These rules take precedence over any general
  best practices that may conflict with them.

Ensure that your implementation accurately reflects the provided implementation
plan and adheres to all specified rules. Pay close attention to the component
structure, API integration, and handling of user interactions.
