reflects the actuall state, purpose and general description of a documentation
for a functionality:

<documentation>
#file:clean-repository.md 
</documentation>

First check tech stack: <tech_stack> #file:tech-stack.md </tech_stack>

Then find related with this functionality functions, methods, folders <files>
#file:commands #file:actions #file:prompts </files>

Remember to focus solely on a functionality mentioned in the given

informations.
