# AI Rules for Amplience CLI Tool

A Node.js command-line application designed to automate bulk operations within the Amplience CMS, addressing the need for efficient content management that is not available through the standard UI. The initial version (MVP) focuses on bulk updating the `deliveryKey` of content items based on a rich set of filters, featuring interactive CLI interface, advanced filtering options, safe dryRun mode by default, and detailed Markdown reporting.

## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for SUPPORT_LEVEL

#### SUPPORT_EXPERT

- Favor elegant, maintainable solutions over verbose code. Assume understanding of language idioms and design patterns.
- Highlight potential performance implications and optimization opportunities in suggested code.
- Frame solutions within broader architectural contexts and suggest design alternatives when appropriate.
- Focus comments on 'why' not 'what' - assume code readability through well-named functions and variables.
- Proactively address edge cases, race conditions, and security considerations without being prompted.
- When debugging, provide targeted diagnostic approaches rather than shotgun solutions.
- Suggest comprehensive testing strategies rather than just example tests, including considerations for mocking, test organization, and coverage.
-

### Guidelines for DOCUMENTATION

#### JSDOC

- Document all functions, classes, and methods with consistent JSDoc comments
- Use @param tags to document function behavior comprehensively
- Implement @example tags with realistic usage scenarios for Amplience API interactions and complex CLI operations
- Do not use @returns or @throws tags to avoid duplication from typescript
- Use @typedef for documenting complex object structures when not using TypeScript
- Configure documentation generation as part of the build process to keep docs current
- Implement custom templates to match kebab-case file naming and TypeScript path alias conventions

### Guidelines for PROJECT_STRUCTURE

#### BARREL_EXPORTS

- Create index.ts barrel files in each directory containing multiple modules to re-export all public APIs
- Use barrel exports to simplify imports and create clean grouped imports from related modules
- Place barrel files in directories that export modules
- Prefer grouped imports over multiple individual import statements when importing from the same barrel
- Example: `import { AmplienceService, CacheService, ReportService } from '~/services'` instead of separate imports
- Configure TypeScript path aliases (`~/*` â†’ `src/*`) to enable clean imports without relative paths
- Use barrel exports to hide internal module complexity and expose only the intended public interface

### Guidelines for VERSION_CONTROL

#### GIT

- Use conventional commits to create meaningful commit messages
- Use feature branches with descriptive names following feat/feature-name or fix/issue-description convention
- Write meaningful commit messages that explain why changes were made, not just what
- Keep commits focused on single logical changes to facilitate code review and bisection
- Use interactive rebase to clean up history before merging feature branches
- Leverage git hooks to enforce code quality checks before commits and pushes

### Guidelines for UNIT

#### VITEST

- Leverage the `vi` object for test doubles - Use `vi.fn()` for function mocks, `vi.spyOn()` to monitor existing functions, and `vi.stubGlobal()` for global mocks. Prefer spies over mocks when you only need to verify interactions without changing behavior.
- Master `vi.mock()` factory patterns - Place mock factory functions at the top level of your test file, return typed mock implementations, and use `mockImplementation()` or `mockReturnValue()` for dynamic control during tests. Remember the factory runs before imports are processed.
- Create setup files for reusable configuration - Define global mocks, custom matchers, and environment setup in dedicated files referenced in your `vitest.config.ts`. This keeps your test files clean while ensuring consistent test environments.
- Use inline snapshots for readable assertions - Replace complex equality checks with `expect(value).toMatchInlineSnapshot()` to capture expected output directly in your test file, making changes more visible in code reviews.
- Monitor coverage with purpose and only when asked - Configure coverage thresholds in `vitest.config.ts` to ensure critical code paths are tested, but focus on meaningful tests rather than arbitrary coverage percentages.
- Make watch mode part of your workflow - Run `vitest --watch` during development for instant feedback as you modify code, filtering tests with `-t` to focus on specific areas under development.
- Explore UI mode for complex test suites - Use `vitest --ui` to visually navigate large test suites, inspect test results, and debug failures more efficiently during development.
- Handle optional dependencies with smart mocking - Use conditional mocking to test code with optional dependencies by implementing `vi.mock()` with the factory pattern for modules that might not be available in all environments.
- Configure jsdom for DOM testing - Set `environment: 'jsdom'` in your configuration for frontend component tests and combine with testing-library utilities for realistic user interaction simulation.
- Structure tests for maintainability - Group related tests with descriptive `describe` blocks, use explicit assertion messages, and follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern to make tests self-documenting.
- Leverage TypeScript type checking in tests - Enable strict typing in your tests to catch type errors early, use `expectTypeOf()` for type-level assertions, and ensure mocks preserve the original type signatures.
